# Azure Data Platform End2End (V2)
some changes
In this workshop you will learn about the main concepts related to advanced analytics and Big Data processing and how Azure Data Services can be used to implement a modern data warehouse architecture. You will learn what Azure services you can leverage to establish a solid data platform to quickly ingest, process and visualise data from a large variety of data sources. The reference architecture you will build as part of this exercise has been proven to give you the flexibility and scalability to grow and handle large volumes of data and keep an optimal level of performance.

In the exercises in this lab you will build data pipelines using data related to New York City. The workshop was designed to progressively implement an extended modern data platform architecture starting from a traditional relational data pipeline. Then we introduce big data scenarios with large data files and distributed computing. We add non-structured data and AI into the mix and finish off with real-time stream analytics. You will have done all of that by the end of the workshop.

**IMPORTANT**:

* The reference architecture proposed in this workshop aims to explain just enough of the role of each of the Azure Data Services included in the overall modern data platform architecture. This workshop does not replace the need of in-depth training on each Azure service covered.

* The services covered in this course are only a subset of a much larger family of Azure services. Similar outcomes can be achieved by leveraging other services and/or features not covered by this workshop. Specific business requirements may require the use of different services or features not included in this workshop.

* Some concepts presented in this course can be quite complex and you may need to seek more information from different sources to compliment your understanding of the Azure services covered.

## Lab Guide

Throughout a series of 5 labs you will progressively implement a modern data platform architecture using datasets from New York City. 

You will start ingesting relational data about motorvehicle collisions in Manhattan hosted in an Azure SQL Database into your Azure Synapse Analytics data warehouse. Then we will introduce the concepts of data lake and  big data challenges and you will put these into practice by ingesting and processing over 50 million yellow taxi ride records stored as large data files stored in your data lake.

You will then use Databricks and the power of Spark clusters to explore big data files. Then you will incorporate AI into your data pipeline by invoking the Cognitive Services Computer Vision API to automatically generate metadata for New York City street photographs and store the metadata in a Cosmos DB database. Finally, you will use a LogicApp to simulate high-frequency stock purchase transactions as a source of streaming events that you will capture, store and process in real time with Event Hubs, Stream Analytics and Power BI.

By the end of the workshop you will have implemented the lab architecture referenced below:

### [Lab 4: Add AI to your Big Data Pipeline with Cognitive Services](./Lab/Lab4/Lab4.md)
In this lab you will use Azure Data Factory to download New York City images to your data lake. Then, as part of the same pipeline, you are going to use an Azure Databricks notebook to invoke Computer Vision Cognitive Service to generate metadata documents and save them in back in your data lake. The Azure Data Factory pipeline then finishes by saving all metadata information in a Cosmos DB collection. You will use Power BI to visualise NYC images and their AI-generated metadata.

The estimated time to complete this lab is: **75 minutes**.

Step     | Description
-------- | -----
![](./Media/Blue1.png) | Build an Azure Data Factory Pipeline to copy image files from shared Azure Storage
